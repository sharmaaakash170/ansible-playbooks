## 🔧 Prerequisites  

Before running the playbook, ensure you have the following:  

- Ansible installed on your control node  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible
  ```
- SSH access to the target servers  
- Properly configured inventory and variables

## 🚀 Usage  

### 🔹 Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharmaaakash170/ansible-playbook.git
cd ansible-playbook
```

### 🔹 Update Inventory  
Modify `inventory/hosts.yml` to match your target servers.  

Example:  
```ini
[web]
192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### 🔹 Run the Playbook  
Run the playbook against your target hosts:  
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbook.yml
```

To run with a specific tag:  
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbook.yml --tags "install"
```

To run in check mode (dry run):  
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbook.yml --check
```

## 🛠️ Customization  

Modify `group_vars/all.yml` or role-specific variable files to customize configurations.  

Example `group_vars/all.yml`:  
```yaml
mysql_root_password: "your_secure_password"
app_port: 8080
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting  

If you encounter issues, try:  

- Checking Ansible logs with `-vvv` (verbose mode)  
- Verifying SSH access:  
  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@your-server-ip
  ```
- Running `ansible --version` to ensure it's installed correctly
